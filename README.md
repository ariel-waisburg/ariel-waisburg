# Hi everyone, I'm Ariel Waisburg 🕺

#### 🔭 I'm starting my career path as a Full-Stack Developer (after finishing @lewagon 's coding Bootcamp) and that's why I’m looking to collaborate on any project where I can help building amazing products, learn from great developers and share my opinion 😄


1. Currently, I'm learning about "Secure Coding", a [Cybint Solutions](https://www.cybintsolutions.com/) product, which teach main cyber vulnerabilities that your code could suffer 🤟
2. *BA in Business Analytics Candidate* at [ITBA University](https://www.itba.edu.ar/undergraduate/b-a-in-business-and-social-analytics/?lang=en) 👨‍🎓
